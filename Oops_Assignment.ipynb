        " --> Object Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in Python, empowering developers to build modular, maintainable, and scalable applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "OOPs is a way of organizing code that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their behavior. In OOPs, object has attributes thing that has specific data and can perform certain actions using methods.\n",

        "Inheritance in Python\n",
        "Data Abstraction\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> A class is a way of organizing information about a type of data so a programmer can reuse elements when making multiple instances of that data type—for example, if a programmer wanted to make three instances of Car , maybe a BMW, a Ferrari, and a Ford instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",
        "\n",
        " An object type is a user-defined composite datatype that encapsulates a data structure along with the functions and procedures needed to manipulate the data. The variables that form the data structure are called attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " -->  Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It's about \"what\" the object does, not \"how\" it does it. Think of it like driving a car – you interact with the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake without needing to know the intricate workings of the engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, which is a class. It's about restricting direct access to some of an object's components and preventing accidental modification of data. Think of it like a capsule containing medication – the contents are protected within the capsule.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simpler terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction = Hiding complexity (showing only what's necessary)\n",
        "Encapsulation = Bundling data and methods (protecting data and controlling access)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python Magic methods are the methods starting and ending with double underscores '__'. They are defined by built-in classes in Python and commonly used for operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "They are also called Dunder methods, Dunder here means \"Double Under (Underscores)\".\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is the concept in OOPs in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the Parent class. And the class that inherits the properties from the parent class is the Child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many forms\". It refers to the ability of an entity (like a function or object) to perform different actions based on the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Technically, in Python, polymorphism allows same method, function or operator to behave differently depending on object it is working with. This makes code more flexible and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " --> Encapsulation is achieved by bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, typically a class. This bundling is often accompanied by restricting direct access to the internal data from outside the class, which is known as information hiding or data hiding.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. H What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor is a unique function that gets called automatically when an object of a class is created. The main purpose of a constructor is to initialize or assign values to the data members of that class. It cannot return any value other than none.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, both class methods and static methods are defined within a class but differ in their access to class and instance data, and how they are called.\n",
        "Class Method:\n",
        "Definition:\n",
        "A class method is defined using the @classmethod decorator and takes the class itself as its first argument, conventionally named cls.\n",
        "Access:\n",
        "It can access and modify class-level attributes and call other class methods using the cls argument. It does not have access to instance-specific attributes directly.\n",
        "Use Cases:\n",
        "Class methods are commonly used for alternative constructors (methods that create instances of the class in different ways) or for operations that affect the entire class, such as modifying shared class data.\n",
        "Static Method:\n",
        "Definition:\n",
        "A static method is defined using the @staticmethod decorator and does not take self (instance) or cls (class) as its first argument. It behaves like a regular function but is logically grouped within the class.\n",
        "Access:\n",
        "It cannot access or modify instance-specific or class-level attributes directly. It operates independently of any specific instance or the class's state.\n",
        "Use Cases:\n",
        "Static methods are suitable for utility functions that are logically related to the class but do not require access to the class's or instance's state. For example, a validation function for input data related to the class.\n",
        "Key Differences Summarized:\n",
        "First Argument: Class methods take cls, static methods take no special first argument.\n",
        "Access to State: Class methods can access and modify class state, while static methods cannot access class or instance state directly.\n",
        "Purpose: Class methods are for class-level operations and alternative constructors; static methods are for utility functions logically grouped with the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming where a class can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. To overload method, we must change the number of parameters or the type of parameters, or both.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Example\n",
        "class example:\n",
        "   def add(self, a, b):\n",
        "      x = a+b\n",
        "      return x\n",
        "   def add(self, a, b, c):\n",
        "      x = a+b+c\n",
        "      return x\n",
        "\n",
        "obj = example()\n",

        "print (obj.add(10,20,30))\n",
        "print (obj.add(10,20))\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding, in object-oriented programming, is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A decorator feature in Python wraps in a function, appends several functionalities to existing code and then returns it. Methods and functions are known to be callable as they can be called. Therefore, a decorator is also a callable that returns callable.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism is important in OOP because it enables code reusability, flexibility, and scalability by allowing a single action or method to be performed in various ways by different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint or template for other classes. It is designed to define a common interface and enforce a consistent structure among its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "The main advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are modularity, code reusability through inheritance, flexibility and extensibility via polymorphism, enhanced security and data integrity from encapsulation and abstraction, improved scalability for complex systems, easier maintenance, and better collaboration among developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        " --> The fundamental difference between a class variable and an instance variable lies in their scope, storage, and how they are accessed and shared among objects of a class.\n",
        "Class Variable:\n",
        "Scope:\n",
        "Defined at the class level, outside of any instance methods. It belongs to the class itself, not to any specific instance.\n",
        "Storage:\n",
        "There is only one copy of a class variable, shared by all instances of that class. Changes made to a class variable by one instance are reflected in all other instances.\n",
        "Access:\n",
        "Can be accessed using the class name (e.g., ClassName.variable_name) or through an instance (e.g., instance_name.variable_name), though the former is preferred for clarity when referring to the shared nature.\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "Often used for constants, shared configurations, or data that needs to be consistent across all instances of a class (e.g., a counter for the number of instances created).\n",
        "Instance Variable:\n",
        "Scope:\n",
        "Defined within an instance method (typically the constructor, __init__ in Python). It belongs to a specific instance of the class.\n",
        "Storage:\n",
        "Each instance of the class gets its own independent copy of the instance variables. Changes made to an instance variable in one object do not affect the same variable in other objects.\n",
        "Access:\n",
        "Can only be accessed through an instance of the class (e.g., instance_name.variable_name).\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "Used to store data that is unique to each individual object, representing its specific state or characteristics (e.g., the name of a person object, the balance of a bank account object).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -- > Inheritance is the mechanism to achieve the re-usability of code as one class(child class) can derive the properties of another class(parent class). It also provides transitivity ie. if class C inherits from P then all the sub-classes of C would also inherit from P.\n",
        "\n",
        " 19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " __str__ and __repr__ are special methods (often called \"dunder methods\" for their double underscores) that define how an object is represented as a string. They serve different purposes and are aimed at different audiences.\n",
        "\n",
        " 20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " --> The super() function in Python holds significant importance in object-oriented programming, particularly when dealing with inheritance. Its primary purpose is to provide a way to access methods and properties of a parent or sibling class from within a child or subclass\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " --> The __del__ method in Python, often referred to as a destructor, holds significance in object-oriented programming for managing resources and performing cleanup actions when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        " 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   The primary difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python lies in their access to the class and its instances.\n",
        "@classmethod:\n",
        "Takes cls as the first argument:\n",
        "A class method receives the class itself as its first parameter, conventionally named cls. This allows the method to access and modify class-level attributes and call other class methods.\n",
        "Can access and modify class state:\n",
        "Because it receives cls, a class method can interact with the class's attributes and potentially change the class's state, affecting all instances.\n",
        "Commonly used for factory methods:\n",
        "Class methods are frequently employed to create alternative constructors or factory methods that return instances of the class based on different input parameters or conditions.\n",
        "@staticmethod:\n",
        "Does not take self or cls as an argument:\n",
        "A static method does not receive any special first argument like self (for instance methods) or cls (for class methods).\n",
        "Cannot access or modify class or instance state:\n",
        "Due to the lack of self or cls, static methods cannot directly access or modify class-level attributes or instance-specific data.\n",
        "Used for utility functions:\n",
        "Static methods are typically used for utility functions that are logically related to the class but do not require any knowledge of the class's state or its instances. They behave like regular functions but are encapsulated within the class's namespace.\n",
        "In summary:\n",
        "Choose @classmethod when the method needs to interact with the class itself (e.g., access class attributes, create new instances of the class).\n",
        "Choose @staticmethod when the method is a standalone utility function that happens to be logically grouped with the class but does not require access to the class or instance state.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many forms\", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a technique that allows for the sequential invocation of multiple methods on a single object within a continuous line of code. This is achieved by having each method in the chain return the object itself (or a modified version of it), enabling the next method to be called directly on the returned object without the need for intermediate variable assignments.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of the __call__ method in Python is to enable instances of a class to be invoked as if they were functions. When an object that has a __call__ method defined is \"called\" using parentheses, like object_instance(argument1, argument2), the __call__ method of that object is automatically executed.\n",
